I have provided a full report for the entire assignment in the repository as well.
To execute the scripts, download and use the virtual environment, which I couldn't provide due to size.

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Once in the virtual environment, run:

```
pip install matplotlib scipy numpy
```

Once the installations are done, the scripts can be run as:

```
python3 ./task_x.py
```
By replacing 'x' with whichever task you would like to run.

You can now see the plots in the ```/plots``` directory.
